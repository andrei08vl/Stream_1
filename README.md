## Jonas Brothers music web page

This site is used by a music band known as Jonas-Brothers where they can post news, videos, 
pictures, events and get in touch with their fans via email.

Web address:[jbmusicweb.000webhostapp.com](http://jbmusicweb.000webhostapp.com)

To show my understanding I uploaded the web page and the heroku server 'https://mighty-hollows-13525.herokuapp.com/'

For the dashboard page must be accessed 'http://jbmusicweb.000webhostapp.com/JB_admin.html' login page
Account name and password are:
account-name: Jonas-Brothers
password: JohnLennon1964

### Dashboard:

From the dashboard the band can post and edit some news / discussions, pictures, 
video clips or YouTube links and musical events

### Details

To see the page views I used [reliablecounter](http://www.reliablecounter.com/),
it is very simple, after you enter the web page address, an anchor will be generated
then copy that anchor tag into your project

As server side are two options for front end node.js and the old php.
I chose php because it has a higher compatibility with web servers and is easy to understand,
of course for more complex or more secure applications, it is advisable to use node.js
The disadvantage of node.js is compatibility can only be used with special servers such as heroku.

For this project:
	- first used the Stream_1 knowledge
	- for bootstrap [bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
	- for JQuery [docs](http://api.jquery.com/) and [sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/)
	- for PHP [sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/)
	- for JS [sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/), 'https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript'
	  and some knowledge from school
	  
To send emails from contact form I used 'https://formspree.io/' service, the email address of the music band is:
